# KitOps Compatible Tools

KitOps ModelKits integrate seamlessly with the tools your team already uses for model development, CI/CD, registry management, and production deployment.

Built on Open Container Initiative ([OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)) standards, KitOps works anywhere containers do — across cloud, on-prem, or local environments.

**⚡ KitOps is trusted by teams using GitLab, MLFlow, Weights & Biases, Jupyter, Hugging Face, Kubernetes, KServe, Red Hat OpenShift, and more!**

The KitOps community has built some great integrations:
- [Import directly from Hugging Face](../../cli/cli-reference.md#kit-import)
- Example workflows for [CI/CD platforms](../cicd.md)
- Outputting ModelKits directly from [MLFlow](../mlflow.md)
- Deploying to any [Kubernetes distribution](../k8s-init-container.md)
- Working with ML in [KServe](../kserve.md)
- Building ML pipelines with [Kubeflow Pipeline components](../kubeflow.md)
